# RDKit_Practice

RDKit is one of the most important tools found in a cheminformatician's toolbox. However, the module can be quite complicated. In an attempt to improve myself as a python coder, I have created a public repository containing notebooks of practice code. These will contain scripts that I have found online and have adapted for my own use. 

If there are any questions or issues, feel free to discuss them here. Hopefully we both get better at this!
